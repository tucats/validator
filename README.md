# validator v0.1.4

This is a JSON validator package. It allows tags to be added to structure definitions, and those structures are
then passed to a Define() operation which creates a map of the valid structure definitions. Subsequently, JSON
strings can be validated against the structure definitions to report if they are conformant or not.

This is intended to help catch misspelled fields, missing require fields, and invalid field values.

## Using the `validate` tag

Use the Go tag `validate` to identify what validations will be done on the JSON representation of the structure.
The tag is followed by a quoted string containing comma-separate validation operations. These operations are:

| Operation | Operand | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| required | | If specified, this field _must_ appear in the JSON |
| min | any | The minimum int or float value allowed for this field |
| max | any | The maximum int or float value allowed for this field |
| minlen | integer | The minimum length of a string value, or smallest allowed array size |
| maxlen | integer | The maximum length of a string value. or largest allowed array size |
| enum | strings | A list of strings separated by vertical bars enumerating the allowed field values |
| matchcase| | The enumerated values must match case to match the field value |

Note that some operations cannot be performed on all data types. For example, `min` and `max` can be
used with a time.Time value to compare the time provided in the JSON to specific time values. However,
these are not applicable to fields containing maps. By contrast, a map can only support the `enum`
operator to validate the key values in the map. There are no validations for the values of the map.

Here is an example of a set of structures that are to be used to process JSON data. The associated `json`
and `validate` tags indicate how the field names are handled by JSON and the additional validation to be
done.

```go


type Address struct {
    Street string `json:"street" validate:"required,minlength=1,maxlen=100"`
    City   string `json:"city"   validate:"required,minlength=1,maxlen=100"`
}

type Person struct {
    Name    string  `json:"name"    validate:"required,minlen=1,maxlen=100"`
    Age     int     `json:"age"     validate:"required,min=18,max=65"`
    Address Address `json:"address" validate:"required"`
}

type Employees struct {
    Department string   `json:"department" validate:"required"`
    Division   string   `json:"division"   validate:"required,enum=HR|Finance|Marketing|Engineering"`
    Staff      []Person `json:"staff"      validate:"minlen=1"`
}
```

## Creating a new Validator object

A validator object is created by passing an instance of the structure to the validator, which
builds a data structure that defines how the validation is to be performed.  For example,

```go
    employeeValidator, err := validator.New(&Employees{})
```

The error return can indicate invalid tags or unsupportable data types for validation in the
data structure.

## Validating a JSON string

To validate a JSON string to see if it contains a valid representation of the object, use
the `Validate()` method for the validator object previously created.

```go
    // Read the JSON file and validate it's contents.
    b, err := io.ReadFile("my.json")
    if err == nil {
        err = employeeValidator(string(b))
    }

    // JSON text does not violate any specified data requirements...

```

This (oversimplified) example shows validating the JSON data (which must be represented as
a string) to verify that the JSON representation contains the required fields, no misspelled
field names, and no invalid values. If the error return is nil, no errors where found.

Currently, the validator stops on the first error it finds and reports it.
